**Name**: [NN Learning for images](https://github.com/Ivan-Bebeshko/Yandex_Practicum/blob/4863d736e2ff7d03fb251232886a4ab9330525b3/10_NN_for_images/10_%20neural_network_learning.ipynb)

**Goals**:
  - Perform EDA and determine features of dataframe with images.
  - Create Neural Network for age prediction based on dataframe with photos:
    - based on Keras ResNet50 which is residual neural network that was used as the backbone.
  - Use Keras interface and Adam optimizer to get MAE less than 8.
  
**Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Keras, ResNet50, Adam

**Project language**: Russian.
